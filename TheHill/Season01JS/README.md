# JavaScript, Season-1

- Progressive enhancement
- SOLO
- Duration : 5 days
- Deadline : 25/06/2021

## Structure

The folder consists of several exercises, divided into 11 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.
Each exercise is contained in a subfolder which contains a _index.html_ and a _script.js_, further explanations can be found in the _index.html_.

Some exercises are repeated in relation to the Intro-JS and this is totally intentional, in order to check if all the main notions have been well assimilated.

If you need to review some basics, you can always go back to the [JS introduction](../../../01.The-Field/06.Intro-JS/readme.md).

> 🤟 **NOTE:** The exercises in series 9 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

> ☝️  Each exercise must be done.

### ES2015+ ?

You might quickly notice, while you research, that there's an _ancient_ and a
_new_ *JavaScript* named _ES2015_ or _ES2016_, _ES2017_, _ES2018_, _ES2019_, _ES2020_etc... These are
new standards, you just have to remember that the current accepted standard is
*ES2015*.

### Section 5, next

Once you finished _section 5_ you should read this one on the [DOM](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cxgqDgA4JTGkvBHrgCuBDIzSDOK5RLDoJdVMAq9l3wk/edit?usp=sharing)

### Section 11

For the exercises using fetch you will need a *REST API*. We once again got you
covered with a little script to run said *API* in *local*, follow the step
below:

* open a terminal
* go to the folder _01.Season-1_ (in this repo)
* run `npm run api`

From there you will have the *REST API* running on _localhost_ on the port 3000.

### Local server

Even though it's _not required_ for most exercises, it can be a plus to run your script on a local server => [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/)
