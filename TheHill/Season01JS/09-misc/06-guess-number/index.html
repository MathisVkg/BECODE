                <p>When the page is loaded, the script picks a number (X) between 1 and 100 and then asks the user to
                    guess that number. For each guess, the script responds "higher" or "lower" if X is higher - or lower
                    - than the user's guess, or "that's it!" when the guess is correct, as well as "you needed Y
                    guesses" (where Y is the number of guesses).</p>
