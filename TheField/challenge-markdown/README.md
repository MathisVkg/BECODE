## A funny story
One day when I was younger, I was helping my father to make something and I wanted to walk around in balance on a wooden plank on the ground. I walk step by step and there comes a time when one of my feet does not move, I lower my head and see that a nail has completely gone through my foot. :)
 * **Summerise**
   <br>Father, help, stupid idea, foot, nail
